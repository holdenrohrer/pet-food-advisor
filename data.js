      "contents": "Question | Rationale | Action\n---|---|---\nDescribe how your cat spends his or her day. | Evaluate access to outside and other sources of food. Cats with unsupervised access outdoors may be ingesting other foods. | Consider confining cats indoors for 1 month and then assess effectiveness of nutritional management.\nHow many other pets are in your house? | Evaluate access to other pets' food (dogs, cats, birds, 'pocket pets', etc). | Remove all food after feeding or confine the hyperthyroid cat to areas without access to other pets' food and reassess after 1 month.\nWhat is your cat's favorite food or treat? | This is a nonthreatening way of determining if the cat is being offered treats or other food. Many owners don't consider people food or treats as part of the 'diet' or they may not mention them. | Reinforce that Hill's Prescription Diet y/d Cat Food must be the sole source of nutrition. Some high-iodine foods include dairy products, egg yolks, seafood, dried fruit, canned vegetables, cured meats, fresh chicken or turkey (with broth or additives injected), soy products, seaweed products (carrageen, alginate), and red dye #3 or E 127 erythrosine (found in many foods/pills that are red or brown color). Additional dietary iodine information is available on websites about human thyroid health.\nWhat are you feeding your cat? | Evaluate what foods are being offered and ask questions to determine what other foods are accessible to the patient. | Reinforce that Hill's Prescription Diet y/d Cat Food must be the sole source of nutrition. See above for a list of common foods and ingredients that may be high in iodine.\nHow are you feeding your cat? | Allow owners to describe how they store, prepare and serve the food. Contamination with iodine can occur if Hill's y/d Feline is decanted and stored in containers or is served in bowls not thoroughly cleaned that have previously been used for other foods. | Recommend storing Hill's Prescription Diet y/d Cat Food in the original bag or can. If food is decanted into a storage container, it should be new or thoroughly cleaned (dishwasher). Likewise, the bowl/serving dish should be new or thoroughly cleaned and used exclusively for Hill's Prescription Diet y/d Cat Food.\nWhat medications or supplements are you giving your cat? | Allow owners to describe all medications and supplements. | Flavored or artificially colored medications or supplements, supplements with fish or shell fish ingredients, and liquids used by compounding pharmacies can be sources of iodine.\nWho feeds your cat? | Evaluate the possibility that other members of the family are inadvertently contaminating the feeding dish or giving other foods. | Designate one person in the household to be responsible for feeding the hyperthyroid cat and cleaning the feeding dishes.\nDo you have children living at home? | It's possible for cats to consume foods dropped on the floor, left on counters or offered as treats (when parents aren't watching). | Reinforce that Hill's Prescription Diet y/d Cat Food must be the sole source of nutrition. See above for a list of common foods and ingredients that are high in iodine.\nWhat is the cat's water source? | Most municipal water sources contain minute amounts of iodine; however, other sources (e.g., well water, ponds) may contain more. | Consider switching to distilled water for 1 month and then re-evaluate effectiveness of nutritional management."

Pruritic dermatitis, eosinophilic granuloma complex: Adverse food reactions in cats typically occur as non-seasonal pruritic dermatitis. Some cats with adverse food reactions have clinical signs of eosinophilic granuloma complex. Chronic gastroenteritis, chronic colitis: Adverse food reactions can result in chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea associated with gastrointestinal inflammation. Mildly affected cats may only show an increase in the number of bowel movements or may have only occasional vomiting.

      "contents": "Kidney Care\nPrescription Diet k/d Cat Food\nEvidence-Based Clinical Nutrition:\n- A 2-year clinical study of cats with naturally occurring chronic kidney disease compared the effects of feeding the nutrition of Prescription Diet k/d versus a typical adult grocery food. Cats with IRIS stage 2 and 3 kidney disease (serum creatinine between 2.1-4.5 mg/dL) fed Prescription Diet k/d had no uremic episodes, while 26% of the control group experienced uremic crises. There were significantly less CKD-related deaths in the group of cats fed Prescription Diet k/d (0%) compared with the group of cats fed the maintenance control food (22%).\n- A 6 month clinical study demonstrated that cats with CKD consuming Prescription Diet k/d had a significant increase in body weight and no change in lean body mass, while cats with CKD fed a positive control food had significant loss of body weight and lean body mass. Cats also consumed 23 per cent more calories when fed Prescription Diet k/d as compared with cats fed the positive control food.\u00b2\n- A prospective study involving 128 cats with various stages of CKD fed Prescription Diet k/d for 12 months demonstrated that 94% of cats successfully transitioned onto the food, while 89% of cats moderately or extremely liked the food and 68% of cats were moderately or extremely enthusiastic while eating the food. Markers of kidney function were stable and pet parent assessed quality of life improved.\u00b3\n- A retrospective study demonstrated that cats with CKD fed Prescription Diet k/d dry had significantly longer median survival time and lower serum creatinine levels (18.1 months, 242 umol/l) as compared to cats with CKD fed a non-therapeutic food (8.5 months, 277 umol/l).\n- The only renal solution with breakthrough Enhanced Appetite Trigger (\u0395.\u0391.\u03a4.) for cats, proven to significantly increase appetite in cats with chronic kidney disease. 6.7\n- Cats eating Prescription Diet k/d maintained their body condition and body weight.8\nAdditional information:\n- Prescription Diet k/d has increased dietary buffering capacity. This helps counteract the tendency for metabolic acidosis, a common complication as kidney disease progresses. Ideal for long-term feeding of cats with kidney disease.Dry and canned formulas can be mixed or fed concurrently.\nOther products to consider:\n- For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) IRIS Stages 3-4 and all IRIS stages with proteinuria: Prescription Diet k/d + j/d Cat Food\n- For patients with early chronic kidney disease (CKD) IRIS Stages 1-2 (non-proteinuric): Prescription Diet k/d Early Support Cat Food, Prescription Diet k/d + j/d Cat Food\n- For patients with CKD and concurrent osteoarthritis: Prescription Diet k/d + j/d Cat Food\n- For patients with acute kidney insult: Prescription Diet k/d + j/d Cat Food, Prescription Diet k/d Early Support Cat Food\n- For patients with uremic encephalopathy: Prescription Diet k/d + j/d Cat Food\n- For patients with urate or cystine urolithiasis: Prescription Diet k/d Early Support Cat Food, Prescription Diet k/d + j/d Cat Food\n- For patients with hepatic encephalopathy, including hepatic lipidosis: Prescription Diet k/d Early Support Cat Food"

In the case of non-sterile struvite uroliths, it is important to treat with the appropriate antibiotic in addition to dietary management.\n\n1 Adjustments must be made for environmental conditions, activity level, body condition and breed size. As reflected in the feeding tables, smaller breed dogs can require 15% to 25% more kilocalories per pound of body weight than larger breed dogs. Provide fresh water in a clean container daily.\n\n2 Kilocalories of metabolizable energy (ME)\n\n3 This daily amount should be divided into several small meals throughout the day.\n\n4 For each additional 10 lbs of body weight, feed an additional 114 kilocalories."

Promote Microbiome Balance with Nutrition**\n\n**PROBIOTICS**\nLive microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.\nProbiotics are strain-specific and dose-dependent, meaning that different strains have different effects and they must be given in specific amounts.\n\n**PREBIOTICS**\nSoluble fibers that are selectively fermented by beneficial bacteria, resulting in increased microbial diversity and the production of short-chain fatty acids that nourish colonocytes.\nProducts that contain both prebiotics and probiotics are called synbiotics.\n\n**COLOSTRUM**\nContains bioactives and antibodies that initiate a beneficial immune response and help to stabilize intestinal microflora.\nStudies show that when fed diets supplemented with bovine colostrum bioactives, both kittens and adult dogs have stronger responses to vaccinations."

      "contents": "## INTERNATIONAL RENAL INTEREST SOCIETY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIRIS was created to help practitioners better diagnose, understand, and treat renal disease in cats and dogs. They have created an internationally recognized set of guidelines for classifying and treating kidney disease. The staging system is not used to make a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease but is used to facilitate appropriate treatment, monitoring, and further diagnostics. The IRIS staging system is based primarily on serum creatinine concentrations of well-hydrated dogs and cats. For further staging and recommendations, please visit: http://www.iris-kidney.com/guidelines/index.html\n\n| STAGE | BLOOD CREATININE* \u00b5mol/l mg/dl SDMA#\u00b5g/dl DOGS | BLOOD CREATININE* \u00b5mol/l mg/dl SDMA#\u00b5g/dl CATS | COMMENTS |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | <125 <1.4 <18 | <140 <1.6 <18 | Normal blood creatinine or normal or mild increase blood SDMA. Some other renal abnormality present (such as, inadequate urinary concentrating ability without identifiable non-renal cause (in cats not dogs), abnormal renal palpation or renal imaging findings, proteinuria of renal origin, abnormal renal biopsy results, increasing blood creatinine or SDMA concentrations in samples collected serially). Persistently elevated blood SDMA concentration (>14 \u00b5g/dl) may be used to diagnose early CKD. |\n| 2 | 125-250 1.4-2.8 18-35 | 140-250 1.6-2.8 18-25 | Normal or mildly increased creatinine, mild renal azotemia (lower end of the range lies within reference ranges for creatinine for many laboratories, but the insensitivity of creatinine concentration as a screening test means that patients with creatinine values close to the upper reference limit often have excretory failure). Mildly increased SDMA. Clinical signs ususally mild or absent. |\n| 3 | 251-440 2.9-5.0 36-54 | 251-440 2.9-5.0 26-38 | Moderate renal azotemia. Many extrarenal signs may be present, but their extent and severity may vary. If signs are absent, the case could be considered as early Stage 3, while presence of many or marked systemic signs might justify classification as late Stage 3. |\n| 4 | >440 >5.0 >54 | >440 >5.0 >38 | Increasing risk of systemic clinical signs and uremic crises. |\n\n*The blood creatinine concentrations apply to average size dogs - those of extreme size may vary. #The recommendations for SDMA are based on published literative which utilizes proprietary IDEXX technology for measuring SDMA. At this time, it is not known if other assays will provide equivalent results."

RSS is used to develop diets that lower the concentration of ions contributing to struvite and calcium oxalate urolithiasis\n*   **URINE DILUTION**\n    Increasing the urine volume reduces the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and struvite crystals\n*   **CONTROLLED MAGNESIUM**\n    Reduced level of magnesium, a natural component of struvite stones\n\n**ADDITIONAL BENEFITS:**\n\n*   This diet promotes a urinary environment unfavorable to the development of both struvite and calcium oxalate crystals\n*   RSS methodology predicts the crystallization potential and is used to develop diets that help prevent struvite and calcium oxalate stones. Low RSS values for struvite and calcium oxalate indicate that the diet can help prevent both struvite and calcium oxalate crystals and stones, as well as help dissolve pure struvite stones\n*   Promotes dilute urine undersaturated for struvite to help dissolve existing pure struvite stones and crystals and to help prevent new ones from forming\n*   Promotes dilute urine metastable for calcium oxalate to help prevent new calcium oxalate stones and crystals from forming\n*   Moderately increased sodium chloride content to increase thirst and promote formation of dilute urine\n*   Enriched with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA), long chain omega-3 fatty acids that help minimize clinical signs of inflammation\n*   Enriched with a blend of antioxidants to help maintain a healthy immune system and to reduce DNA damage associated with cell aging\n*   Chelated minerals improve digestive and metabolic utilization of trace elements\n\n**NOTES:**\n*   As a result of increased thirst, dogs will need free access to fresh water and access to areas that permit appropriate urination\n*   Diet can be complemented with ROYAL CANIN\u00ae Urinary Canine Treats at 10% or less of total daily calories\n\n**DAILY FEEDING RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n| Body Weight (lb) | Body Weight (kg) | Tendency to Become Overweight Cups | Tendency to Become Overweight Grams | Ideal

Promotes dilute urine undersaturated for struvite to help dissolve existing pure struvite stones and crystals and to help prevent new ones from forming\n*   Promotes dilute urine metastable for calcium oxalate to help prevent new calcium oxalate stones and crystals from forming\n*   Enriched with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA), long chain omega-3 fatty acids that help minimize clinical signs of inflammation\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   As a result of increased thirst, dogs will need free access to fresh water and access to areas that permit appropriate urination\n*   Diet can be complemented with ROYAL CANIN\u00ae URINARY Canine Treats at 10% or less of total daily calories\n\n## Recommended For:\n\n*   Lower urinary tract disease\n*   Dissolution of pure struvite

      "contents": "## Nutritional Benefits:\n\n**Struvite Dissolution:** Provides nutrition that aids in the management of pure struvite uroliths.\n\n**Low RSS:** Relative Supersaturation (RSS) methodology predicts the crystallization potential of urine. RSS is used to develop diets that lower the concentration of ions contributing to struvite and calcium oxalate urolithiasis.\n\n**Urine Dilution:** Increasing the urine volume reduces the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and struvite crystals.\n\n**Controlled Magnesium:** Reduced level of magnesium, a natural component of struvite stones.\n\n**Additional Benefits:**\n\nThis diet promotes a urinary environment unfavorable to the development of both struvite and calcium oxalate crystals.\n\n*   RSS methodology predicts the crystallization potential and is used to develop diets that help prevent struvite and calcium oxalate stones. Low RSS values for struvite and calcium oxalate indicate that the diet can help prevent both struvite and calcium oxalate crystals and stones, as well as help dissolve pure struvite stones\n*   Promotes dilute urine undersaturated for struvite to help dissolve existing pure struvite stones and crystals and to help prevent new ones from forming\n*   Promotes dilute urine metastable for calcium oxalate to help prevent new calcium oxalate stones and crystals from forming\n*   Moderately increased sodium chloride content to increase thirst and promote formation of dilute urine\n*   Enriched with a blend of antioxidants to help maintain a healthy immune system and to reduce DNA damage associated with cell aging\n*   Enriched with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA), long chain omega-3 fatty acids that help minimize clinical signs of inflammation\n*   Chelated minerals improve digestive and metabolic utilization of trace elements\n\nNOTES:\n\n*   As a result of increased thirst, cats will need free access to fresh water and access to areas that permit appropriate urination\n*   Diet can be complemented with ROYAL CANIN\u00ae Urinary Feline Treats at 10% or less of total daily calories\n\n## Daily Feeding Recommendations:\n\n| Body Weight (lb) | Body Weight (kg) | Tendency to Become Overweight (Cups) | Tendency to Become Overweight (Grams) |

RSS is used to develop diets that lower the concentration of ions contributing to struvite and calcium oxalate urolithiasis\n\n**Urine Dilution:** Increasing the urine volume reduces the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and struvite crystals\n\n**Controlled Magnesium:** Reduced level of magnesium, a natural component of struvite stones\n\n**ADDITIONAL BENEFITS:**\n\nThis diet promotes a urinary environment unfavorable to the development of both struvite and calcium oxalate crystals\n\n*   RSS methodology predicts the crystallization potential and is used to develop diets that help prevent struvite and calcium oxalate stones. Low RSS values for struvite and calcium oxalate indicate that the diet can help prevent both struvite and calcium oxalate crystals and stones, as well as help dissolve pure struvite stones\n*   Promotes dilute urine undersaturated for struvite to help dissolve existing pure struvite stones and crystals and to help prevent new ones from forming\n*   Promotes dilute urine metastable for calcium oxalate to help prevent new calcium oxalate stones and crystals from forming\n*   Enriched with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA), long chain omega-3 fatty acids that help minimize clinical signs of inflammation\n\n**RECOMMENDED FOR:**\n*   Lower urinary tract disease\n*   Dissolution of pure struvite uroliths\n*   Prevention of struvite urolithiasis\n*   Prevention of calcium oxalate urolithiasis\n\n**NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:**\n*   Growth\n*   Reproduction\n\n**DAILY FEEDING RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n| Body Weight (lb) | Body Weight (kg) | Tendency to Become

      "contents": "## Hematuria Detection\n\n**Royal Canin Hematuria Detection bl\u00fccare Litter Granules**\n\nTechnology by bl\u00fccare\n\nAvailable in a 1.4 oz (40 g) bag containing two 0.7 oz (20 g) pouches\n\n**Most Appropriate for Cats Fed:**\n*   A cat with first or recurrent FLUTD and hematuria on urinalysis\n*   A cat showing house-soiling signs to help differentiate between behavioral and medical causes\n\n**Benefits:**\n*   Helps to detect hematuria which is present in most feline urinary disorders\n*   A pouch of hematuria detection allows to check daily the presence of blood in cat's urine up to 3 weeks\n*   Easy to use and stress free as it works with cat's current litterbox.\n\n**Instructions for Use**\n\n1.  SPREAD the granules over cat litter.\n2.  INSPECT the litter box after the cat urinates. The granules in contact with urine swell. If blood is detected, a reaction will occur.\n3.  IF GRANULES REMAIN WHITE, the test is negative.\n4.  IF GRANULES TURN BLUE, the test is positive and shows the presence of blood in cat's urine.\n5.  A CONSULTATION between a cat owner and a veterinarian is necessary.\n\n*Longest duration (up to 3 weeks) are obtained with high quality clumping litter when feces and clumped urine are removed daily.\n\n**Urinary Disease Diagnosed**\n\n*   2-4 weeks after diagnosis: Remission\n*   8-10 weeks after diagnosis\n*   Once each quarter: Regular check\n\n**Indications:**\nHematuria Detection helps detect the presence of blood in feline urine, a sign of most feline urinary disorders. Hematuria Detection comes in the form of small, white granules that are easy to spread over your cat's litter.\n\n**Take Note of the Following:**\nHematuria Detection can be used with most litters available on the market. For better detection results, a clay-based (bentonite) clumping litter is preferred. Test results may be skewed if a cat urinates several times on the same granules. It is highly recommended to clean the litter (removal of clumps and excrement) on a daily basis. Replace the litter according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once sprinkled over the litter and before being in contact with urine, Hematuria Detection granules maintain their effectiveness in the litter box for a period of 30 days or until they come in contact with urine. In cases where the cat's urine contains very few red blood cells, or if the urine has a high pH or extreme urine density, the granules may show no reaction.\n\n**Composition:**\nHematuria Detection granules contain Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), a molecule studied by veterinarians, that allows the color of the granules to change from white to blue when they come into contact with hemoglobin.\n\n**Precautions:**\nRead the instructions carefully before performing the test, as the results can only be properly interpreted if the instructions and recommendations have been followed. Each pouch is a single use only. Do not use if pouch is open or damaged. Place the cat litter in a ventilated room. Make sure to remove clumps and stools every day with a litter shovel. Wash your hands with soap after pouring and removing granules. External use only. Do not swallow. Store granules in a dry place, keep at room temperature and protect from sunlight. Simply dispose of the soiled granules as you would other waste. Warning: Plastic bags can be dangerous. To avoid danger of suffocation, keep this bag away from babies, children and pets."

      "contents": "## Hematuria Detection\n\nRoyal Canin Hematuria Detection is a product that helps detect hematuria which is present in most feline urinary disorders. It is available in a 1.4 oz (40 g) bag containing two 0.7 oz (20 g) pouches.\n\n**Most appropriate for cats fed:**\n*   A cat with first or recurrent FLUTD and hematuria on urinalysis\n*   A cat showing house-soiling signs to help differentiate between behavioral and medical causes\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n*   Helps to detect hematuria which is present in most feline urinary disorders\n*   A pouch of hematuria detection allows to check daily the presence of blood in cat's urine up to 3 weeks*\n*   Easy to use and stress free as it works with cat's current litterbox.\n\n**Urinary Disease Diagnosed:**\n\n| Time                      | Action           |\n| ------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| 2-4 weeks after diagnosis | Remission        |\n| 8-10 weeks after diagnosis| Regular check    |\n| Once each quarter         | Use of Hematuria Detection pouch |\n\n**Instructions for use:**\n\n1.  SPREAD the granules over cat litter.\n2.  INSPECT the litter box after the cat urinates. The granules in contact with urine swell. If blood is detected, a reaction will occur.\n3.  IF GRANULES REMAIN WHITE, the test is negative.\n4.  IF GRANULES TURN BLUE, the test is positive and shows the presence of blood in cat's urine.\n5.  A CONSULTATION between a cat owner and a veterinarian is necessary.\n\n*Longest duration (up to 3 weeks) are obtained with high quality clumping litter when feces and clumped urine are removed daily.\n\n**Indications:**\n\nHematuria Detection helps detect the presence of blood in feline urine, a sign of most feline urinary disorders. Hematuria Detection comes in the form of small, white granules that are easy to spread over your cat's litter.\n\n**Take note of the following:**\n\nHematuria Detection can be used with most litters available on the market. For better detection results, a clay-based (bentonite) clumping litter is preferred. Test results may be skewed if a cat urinates several times on the same granules. It is highly recommended to clean the litter (removal of clumps and excrement) on a daily basis. Replace the litter according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once sprinkled over the litter and before being in contact with urine, Hematuria Detection granules maintain their effectiveness in the litter box for a period of 30 days or until they come in contact with urine. In cases where the cat's urine contains very few red blood cells, or if the urine has a high pH or extreme urine density, the granules may show no reaction.\n\n**Composition:**\n\nHematuria Detection granules contain Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), a molecule studied by veterinarians, that allows the color of the granules to change from white to blue when they come into contact with hemoglobin.\n\n**Precautions:**\n\nRead the instructions carefully before performing the test, as the results can only be properly interpreted if the instructions and recommendations have been followed. Each pouch is a single use only. Do not use if pouch is open or damaged. Place the cat litter in a ventilated room. Make sure to remove clumps and stools every day with a litter shovel. Wash your hands with soap after pouring and removing granules. External use only. Do not swallow. Store granules in a dry place, keep at room temperature and protect from sunlight. Simply dispose of the soiled granules as you would other waste. Warning: Plastic bags can be dangerous. To avoid danger of suffocation, keep this bag away from babies, children and pets."

For more than 50 years, WALTHAM has been a leading scientific authority in pet nutrition and wellness, with over 1,800 veterinary publications and a dedicated staff of renowned veterinary and nutritional scientists.

Royal Canin's proprietary Genetic Health Analysis\u2122 provides insight into the behavioral traits in breeds that have been identified in your dog, the predicted genetic adult weight range and breed-related risks of developing certain genetic diseases. A dog's weight range can vary significantly depending on age, diet and exercise. Genetic Health Analysis is not intended to diagnose diseases or predict behavior in any particular dog.\n\nIn the unlikely event that it is not possible to determine breed history, predicted adult weight range or breed-related health risks, or if an error in the analysis occurs, liability by Royal Canin or related companies and individuals is disclaimed and damages in any event are limited to the payment actually received by Royal Canin for the individual specified analysis at issue.\n\nMany countries and provinces have breed-specific ordinances and laws that may require special handling or prohibit the ownership of some dogs with a particular breed in their genetic background. Genetic Health Analysis is not intended to be used by regulatory or animal control officials to determine whether a particular breed is legislated or banned in a particular community. Nor is Genetic Health Analysis intended to be used in any judicial proceedings. Rather, it is intended to be used as a tool or resource in determining a dog's genetic history. Neither Royal Canin nor any related company is responsible for compliance or notification regarding these matters.\n\nRoyal Canin continues to study the complexities of the canine genome, with the goal of continuing to add breeds and the ability to detect additional breed-related disease conditions to Genetic Health Analysis in the future.\n\nLearn more about Genetic Health Analysis at royalcaningha.com."
